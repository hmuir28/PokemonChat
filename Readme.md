# Pokemon Chat

Pokemon Chat is a web application which allows users to exchange pokemons, of course, it's an application that I created it just to get back to Angular and Node,

## Features

- Send pokemons information to other users in the chat.
- I'm still on it...

## Tech

Pokemon Chat uses:

- Angular 11 - Single Page Application!
- Nebular - Customizable UI kit for modern web apps
- Node.js - evented I/O for the backend
- Express - fast node.js network app framework
- WS - Web sockets to have full-duplex communication with the differente users

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
