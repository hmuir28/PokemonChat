# Pokemon Chat

Pokemon Chat is a web application that allows users to exchange pokemons, of course, it's an application that I created just to get back to Angular, Node and for practicing Typescript, too.

## Features

- Send pokemons information to other users in the chat.
- I'm still on it...

## Tech

Pokemon Chat uses:

- Angular 11 - Single Page Application!
- Nebular - Customizable UI kit for modern web apps
- Node.js - evented I/O for the backend
- Express - fast node.js network app framework
- WS - Web sockets to have full-duplex communication with the differente users

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

### Requeriments
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Client

```sh
cd client
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

### Server

```

For production environments...

**In-Progress...**
